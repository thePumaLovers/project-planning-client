            <Accordion.Body>Hi I’m Ross. I’m a software engineer with an interest in empowering people. Software isn’t just about lines of code on a computer it’s about how those lines of code shape the world around it. l I really love the moment where you take this dream or idea, you look at what you need, how much it costs, the materials involved and say: I can do this. Its manageable. It’s possible. It’s that awesome moment where a dream becomes a plan. I hope our app helps you get there.

            <Accordion.Body>I’m a full-stack engineer with a background in sound design and music. Throughout my career, I’ve found that project management apps can be clunky and have a steep learning curve, so why not create one that isn’t that! Hopefully this little app helps you clear your head a bit and maybe be inspired by other users’ project ideas.
